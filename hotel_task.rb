OO Weekend Homework

Requirements

Apply all the learning of the last two weeks to produce an OO-designed application that models the operations of a hotel.

Single Hotel

We're going to need to model individual hotels, and their rooms -- they can have single or double-rooms. The hotel shold be able to tell us it's capacity.

We also need guests. Guests need to be able check in to rooms at the hotel, and check out at the end of their stays.

Ensure we don't double-book rooms, or over-fill hotels.

The management are going to need reporting on the occupancy, and the revenue (assuming rooms have rates? or at least a standard rate single/double) for the day.

Chain

We've gone big time and have multiple hotels. We need occupancy reporting across all our hotels.
